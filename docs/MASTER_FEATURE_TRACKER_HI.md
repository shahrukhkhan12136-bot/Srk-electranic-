## Current guardrail

## G.1 Electrician Android Rate Card — owner-confirmed 2026-11-11
- [ ] Rate Card list showing all four approved 8-hour Labour categories.
- [ ] Show the 8-hour work duration and only the amount payable to the electrician: Helper ₹764.15; Ordinary ₹1,019.15; Skilled ₹1,359.15; Master ₹1,699.15. Do not display the 8-hour Labour charge/gross amount, commission percentage, commission amount or deduction line anywhere in the electrician-facing Rate Card.
- [ ] Highlight the signed-in electrician's own Admin-approved assigned category and net amount from server-authoritative profile data.
- [ ] Prevent electrician self-edit/tampering of category or rate; Admin changes must be authorized, versioned and audited.
- [ ] Keep the backend Labour-only commission calculation internal; do not show the gross Labour charge or any commission details in electrician Rate Card. Exclude materials/parts from the calculation and preserve separate itemized billing.
- [ ] Keep booking immutable rate snapshots authoritative; later Rate Card changes must not rewrite existing bookings.
- [ ] Test calculation/paise rounding, RLS/API authorization, privacy, responsive/accessibility, loading/offline/error states.
- [~] Requirement documented in Blueprint and Electrician Android README; actual app remains README-only scaffold.




## A.1 Customer Booking — category and price acceptance (owner-confirmed 2026-11-11)
- [ ] Customer sees all active electrician categories and category-wise 8-hour price before placing booking: Helper ₹899.00, Ordinary ₹1,199.00, Skilled ₹1,599.00, Master ₹1,999.00.
- [ ] Customer can select a category; server validates the Admin-approved category/rate and ignores any client-tampered price.
- [ ] Immutable booking snapshot stores category code/label, approved rate/version and duration; subsequent catalogue changes do not alter existing bookings.
- [ ] Customer price display is separate from electrician Rate Card: electrician Rate Card continues to show only 8-hour duration and electrician net amount, never gross Labour or commission details.
- [ ] Verify responsive/accessibility, loading/error/offline states and customer booking E2E. No upfront payment.


## A.2 Customer Booking — duration selector 1–8 hours (owner-confirmed 2026-11-11)
- [ ] Add a single-select duration control for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 hours.
- [ ] Recalculate and show the selected category's total customer Labour price on the customer's mobile screen immediately when duration changes.
- [ ] Formula: approved 8-hour category price × selected integer hours ÷ 8; preserve precision and round only final payable amount to paise using half-up. Examples: Helper 1h ₹112.38, 2h ₹224.75, 8h ₹899.00; Ordinary 1h ₹149.88, 2h ₹299.75, 8h ₹1,199.00.
- [ ] Server validates duration is an integer from 1 through 8 and recalculates from current approved rate/version; never trust client-submitted total.
- [ ] Immutable booking snapshot stores category, rate/version, selected duration and Labour total.
- [ ] Treat selected 1–8 hours as booking preference/initial duration only—not a timer cap or final-bill cap. Timer continues under the approved timer lifecycle; final Labour bill is based on actual elapsed work time, whether shorter or longer than selected duration.
- [ ] Show the selected-duration price at booking as the price for the chosen duration; final amount is calculated from actual server timer duration. Do not auto-stop the timer when selected hours expire.
- [ ] Keep materials separate; no upfront payment. Test responsive/mobile, accessibility, stale/offline/error handling and end-to-end booking.


## A.3 Customer Booking — date-only selection (owner-confirmed 2026-11-11)
- [ ] Booking form में केवल service date का date-picker दिखे; customer time/time-slot picker पूरी तरह हटे।
- [ ] नए booking flow में customer-selected clock-time/slot अनिवार्य न हो; booking date server-side validate और सुरक्षित हो।
- [ ] Date-only intent को backend, availability/matching और booking API में end-to-end support करें; किसी default/कल्पित समय में silently convert न करें।
- [ ] जहाँ वास्तविक operational time बाद में तय करना हो, वह अलग authorized scheduling workflow से हो; customer को booking के समय time चुनना आवश्यक न हो।
- [ ] Past/invalid/unavailable dates, timezone/date-boundary, duplicate booking, reschedule/cancellation और legacy time-slot compatibility के tests पास हों।
- [ ] Existing bookings का historical time data preserve करें; नया customer flow ही date-only हो।
- [ ] Confirm करें कि selected 1–8 hours अभी भी केवल booking preference है; actual timer और final Labour bill वास्तविक elapsed work time पर आधारित रहें।
- [~] Requirement documented; UI/API implementation and E2E verification pending.


## B.1 Electrician ID/Profile — own approved category badge (owner-confirmed 2026-11-11)
- [ ] Electrician के अपने Profile / Electrician ID पर उसकी Admin-approved category का स्पष्ट नाम और badge दिखे: Helper, Ordinary, Skilled या Master।
- [ ] Category केवल server-authoritative verified profile/application assignment से आए; client-supplied category/label को ignore करें।
- [ ] Electrician को अपनी category खुद edit/upgrade/downgrade करने की अनुमति न हो; Admin changes authorized, versioned और audited हों।
- [ ] Pending/rejected/suspended/inactive/missing assignment में कोई गलत default category न दिखे; सही status/error message दिखे।
- [ ] केवल signed-in electrician अपनी category देख सके; अन्य electricians की private assignment सुरक्षित रहे।
- [ ] Profile/ID badge और Rate Card highlight एक ही authoritative category source इस्तेमाल करें।
- [ ] Loading/offline/stale/error, accessibility और mobile E2E तथा RLS/authorization/tampering negative tests पास हों।
- [~] Requirement documented; actual Android/profile UI and API implementation pending.


## B.2 Electrician ID Number — permanent unique number (owner-approved 2026-11-12)
- [ ] Owner-approved format: SRK-EL-000001, SRK-EL-000002… .
- [ ] Issue automatically from server only after Admin approval and account activation.
- [ ] Unique, permanent, never reused; electrician cannot edit or choose it.
- [ ] Keep internal UUID primary key separate from readable public/display ID.
- [ ] Do not encode phone, Aadhaar, DOB or other personal information.
- [ ] Show ID number, approved category badge and current status on electrician's own ID/Profile card.
- [ ] Category changes must not change the permanent ID number; Admin changes remain audited/versioned.
- [ ] Add database uniqueness, transactional sequence/concurrency, authorization and lookup tests.
- [ ] ID alone must never authenticate a user or grant access.
- [I] Owner-approved format; server-side sequence/trigger migration plus security assertions and electrician/Admin ID display wiring are committed to Feature Branch. Migration not applied; runtime authorization/concurrency tests and Preview verification pending.
