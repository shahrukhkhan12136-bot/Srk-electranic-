# SRK ELECTRONIC — Master Checklist Addendum: Founder Welcome-Screen Photo

**Status date:** 15 November 2026  
**Applies to:** Website Welcome Screen / founder identity visual asset  
**Approved asset:** The latest founder portrait uploaded in the conversation on 15 November 2026 (black button-up shirt, arms folded, waist-up framing, blue corporate background).  
**Conversation attachment ID:** `file_000000005f588210ac3459ffcfa3fdfe`  
**Current working copy (this session):** `/mnt/data/18339.png`

## Owner-approved requirement

- [ ] Use the exact latest founder portrait identified above. Do not substitute the older garden portrait.
- [ ] Preserve the subject's natural proportions; do not stretch or distort the image.
- [ ] Display a professional waist-up crop with arms folded and sensible focal positioning.
- [ ] Keep the final asset hosted within the SRK ELECTRONIC Vercel project; do not upload it to a third-party image-hosting website.
- [ ] Integrate the asset into the Welcome Screen and verify the built page loads it correctly.
- [ ] Verify desktop and responsive layout during the consolidated final mobile QA pass; do not run separate mobile QA before all implementation is complete.

## Evidence / current state

- [x] Owner supplied and explicitly selected the latest portrait as the final photo.
- [ ] Persistent reference-image/library save — attempted, but the image-reference service returned `image_unavailable`; do not claim it is saved persistently yet.
- [ ] Add the image binary to the approved feature branch repository.
- [ ] Integrate the image into the Welcome Screen source.
- [ ] Run relevant automated tests and build checks.
- [ ] Confirm Vercel preview build serves the image correctly.
- [ ] Owner visual acceptance.

**Important:** This addendum records the approved requirement and the current conversation attachment identifier. It does not mean the binary has been committed, uploaded to Vercel, integrated, or deployed. Keep Production unchanged until separately authorized.

## Recovery audit — 15 November 2026, 00:20 IST

- The previous Vercel Sandbox session returned `sandbox_stopped`; its filesystem could not be inspected or modified further.
- A recursive Git tree check of the approved feature branch did not find a committed `assets/founder-portrait.webp` (or another founder-photo binary). The earlier sandbox listing is not proof of a Git commit.
- The current branch's `index.html` redirects visitors to `/booking.html`. The customer booking page is not the required three-role website Welcome Screen.
- Therefore, the founder photo is still **not verified as present in the repository, integrated, built, or deployed**. Do not mark these items complete until a fresh working session verifies the exact approved image and page behavior.
- Continue only on `feat/customer-login-first-dashboard-20261114`; do not change Production or deploy without separate approval.
